About
=====
This is my first game, which I made in 2009-2010. It's an arcade-style shooter in which you fight of waves of enemies using a tank that has special wheels capable of moving in any direction.

Also being one of my first programming projects, it's not very well designed or constructed (both the game itself and the code).
